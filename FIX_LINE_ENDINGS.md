# ðŸ”§ Fix Line Ending Issue - Step by Step

## What's Happening?

GitHub Desktop is warning about line ending changes (LF â†” CRLF). This is common on Windows but won't prevent your commit.

## âœ… Solution: 3 Easy Steps

### **Step 1: Add the New File**
âœ… Done! I've created `.gitattributes` file in your project folder
- This file tells Git how to handle line endings
- It's already in your project folder now

### **Step 2: Refresh GitHub Desktop**
1. Go back to **GitHub Desktop**
2. Close the current view (if error dialog is open)
3. GitHub Desktop should automatically refresh
4. You should see `.gitattributes` in the Changes list now

### **Step 3: Commit Again**
1. In the **Summary** field at bottom-left, type:
   ```
   Initial commit: Arogya AI Medical Platform
   ```
2. Click **Commit to main** button
3. **Wait 5-10 seconds** for it to process
4. âœ… Success! Your files should be committed

## ðŸ“‹ What to See After Fix

After these steps:
- âœ… Files should disappear from "Changes" list
- âœ… No more line ending warnings
- âœ… You're ready for Step 5 (Create GitHub Repository)

## ðŸŽ¯ If Still Having Issues

### **Still seeing line ending errors?**

3. Select: **"Normalize line endings"** or **"LF"**
4. Click **Save**
5. Return to GitHub Desktop and try committing again

### **Commit button still greyed out?**
1. Make sure you typed the commit message in the **Summary** field
2. Make sure the Summary field is NOT empty
3. Click **Commit to main** (not any other button)

### **Still can't commit?**
Try this:
1. In GitHub Desktop, click **Repository** â†’ **Discard All Changes**
2. Click **Yes** to confirm
3. Close GitHub Desktop completely
4. Reopen GitHub Desktop
